It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
R is a statistical programming language that provides impressive tools to analyze data and create high-level graphics. This video course will take you from very basics of R to creating insightful machine learning models with R. You will start with setting up the environment and then perform data ETL in R. 

Data exploration examples are provided that demonstrate how powerful data visualization and machine learning is in discovering hidden relationship. 

You will then dive into important machine learning topics, including data classification, regression, clustering, association rule mining, and dimensionality reduction.
